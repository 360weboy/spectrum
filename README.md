## Drop in colorpicker

I wasn't happy with current options for JavaScript colorpickers.  They either relied too heavily on images and external resources, or I didn't like the API they provided.  Here are some of the goals I had for the project:

* No images or other resources
* 1 small javascript file
* Progressive enhancement - hook into an existing input

Technology:
* Uses CSS gradients instead of images
