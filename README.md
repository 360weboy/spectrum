## The No Hassle Colorpicker

I wanted a colorpicker that didn't require images, and that had an API that made sense to me as a developer who has worked with color in a number of applications.  I had used existing plugins (which I was quite grateful for), but decided that I would make a smaller, simpler one.

I started using canvas, and switched to CSS gradients, since it turned out to be easier to manage, and worked better across browsers.

See demo and docs: http://bgrins.github.com/spectrum/

Thanks to https://github.com/DavidDurman/FlexiColorPicker for some inspiration and gradient constants
